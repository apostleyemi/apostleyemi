    Hi, ! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="15px">

</h2>


My name is Adedayo Adegbenro, a seasoned Senior Software Developer with a deep passion for crafting innovative software solutions that bridge business needs with technical expertise. I have extensive experience in full-stack development, specializing in technologies such as C#, ASP.NET Core, PHP, Laravel, and SQL Server. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of leading teams and delivering impactful projects in sectors ranging from education to finance and healthcare.

I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering from Ladoke Akintola University and have successfully developed key applications like Mozfin (a mobile payment app) and LearnAm (an e-learning platform). My proficiency spans across cloud computing, microservice architecture, CI/CD with Docker, and API development for both web and mobile platforms.
